# Audio-Complexity
In this work, we attempt to characterize the complexity of audio for selecting steganographic cover. Specifically, the original cover is first convoluted with a specially designed adaptive convolution operator, the new audio can be reconstructed by convolution. Then, we derive a quantity for measuring the complexity of each frame in an audio clip, based on the residual of the original and reconstructed audio. The setting of the involved hyperparameters are thoroughly discussed via empirical study.
